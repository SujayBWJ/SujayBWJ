**Student Developer | Web • DSA • UI/UX**

I’m a student developer building real engineering skill from first principles.  
Current focus: **JavaScript**, **Data Structures & Algorithms (C++)**, and **Web Development**.

Every project is practice in:
- Thinking clearly  
- Debugging patiently  
- Finishing what I start  

This profile is a public record of that process.

## What I’m Working On

- Strengthening DSA fundamentals in C++
- Building small, complete web apps
- Learning JavaScript deeply before backend
- Developing design sense through UI/UX practice

## Current Projects

### 📝 MyNoter — Offline Note App  
A minimal note-taking web app built with pure HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

- Create notes with title + body  
- Persist data using `localStorage`  
- View notes as a title index  
- Click a title to open the note  
- Delete the currently active note  
- Two-pane layout: index + editor  

What I learned:
- DOM as a state surface  
- `localStorage` as a persistence layer  
- Explicit state management (`currentIndex`)  
- UI as a projection of data

### 📝 Todo App  
A minimal task manager.

- Add, delete, and mark tasks  
- Uses local storage  
- In progress: better structure and state handling  

What I learned:
- Event-driven logic  
- Data persistence  
- Structuring small JS systems

### 🌦 Weather App  
A simple weather application using an external API.

- Fetches live weather data  
- Handles city-based search  
- In progress: error handling, loading states, cleaner UI  

What I learned:
- Working with APIs  
- Async JS and promises  
- Input handling and DOM updates

## Philosophy

Clarity over flash.  
Finishing over flexing.  
Trajectory over appearance.

This is not a portfolio.  
It is a log of deliberate growth.
